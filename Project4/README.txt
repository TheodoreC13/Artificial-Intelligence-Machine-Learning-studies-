Running Instructions:

In the main function, you will find the typical data_X and data_Y that is loaded from the data. You will also find a data_X2 that is the data_X file with a prepended column of 1's
This is used to ensure the functions work properly, but also increases the dimensionality of the data. As such, when running the visualizer functions, the data should be trained with the prepended values but some of the functions might not need the prepended values.

We didnt know what to put in the main function to run outside of testing so we finished all the functions and left the main as an empty canvas.

SOURCES USED:
We used solely the following 3 sources:

The slides
The textbook
https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html?highlight=random#module-numpy.random


NOTE:
The reason we had to use an extra late day (that neither of us had) was because we got stuck for 8 hours on our prepending implementation.
It turned out to be a very simple fix, we just had no idea what we were doing because we didnt understand prepending.
